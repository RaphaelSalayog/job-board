In Apollo Client, both useQuery and useLazyQuery are hooks used for executing GraphQL queries, but they differ in their behavior:

useQuery - is a hook used for executing GraphQL queries at the time a component is rendered.
           When you use useQuery, the query is executed immediately when the component mounts.
           It's suitable for scenarios where you want to fetch data when the component is rendered and re-rendered.
           The data is automatically fetched and cached by Apollo Client, and the loading state and error state are handled automatically.
           useLazyQuery:

useLazyQuery - is a hook used for executing GraphQL queries only when you explicitly call the function it returns.
               It doesn't execute the query immediately when the component mounts; instead, it provides you with a function that you can call whenever you want to execute the query.
               It's useful when you want to execute a query based on user interaction, like a button click or form submission.
               With useLazyQuery, you have more control over when the query is executed, and you can conditionally fetch data based on user actions.
               In summary, useQuery is used for immediately fetching data when a component mounts, while useLazyQuery is used for fetching data on-demand, typically in response to user actions.
